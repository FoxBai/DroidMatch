# Protocol Runtime

This document records M1 runtime limits and scheduling rules that are not obvious from Protobuf schemas alone.

## Envelope Limits

- ADB M1 frames use `uint32_be envelope_length` followed by serialized `RpcEnvelope`.
- `envelope_length` must be greater than `0`.
- Maximum `envelope_length` is 4 MiB.
- Receivers must reject oversized or truncated envelopes with `ERROR_CODE_PROTOCOL_ERROR`.
- `payload_crc32` is optional for ADB M1 and recommended for AOA before it moves beyond experimental.

## Request Scheduling

M1 has one control-plane queue and one data-plane queue per active session.

- Handshake, heartbeat, cancel, pause, diagnostics, and permission-state requests have control priority.
- Directory listing and file mutation are normal control-plane work.
- Transfer chunks are data-plane work and must not block control-plane reads.
- Receivers should process cancel and pause requests even when transfer data is queued.

Control-plane starvation is a bug. If the Mac harness cannot get a heartbeat or cancel response while a transfer is active, M1 should fail that run.

## Concurrency Limits

M1 defaults:

| Resource | Limit |
|---|---:|
| Concurrent transfer streams | 2 |
| Concurrent directory listings | 2 |
| In-flight control requests | 16 |
| Default page size | 200 entries |
| Maximum page size | 1,000 entries |
| Default transfer chunk size | 256 KiB |
| Maximum transfer chunk size | 1 MiB |

The harness may run a single-transfer mode first. Multiple streams are included so the scheduler shape is clear before product UI work begins.

## Backpressure

- Senders must not exceed the negotiated `OpenTransferResponse.chunk_size_bytes`.
- Receivers may use `TransferChunkAck.next_offset_bytes` as a checkpoint and backpressure signal.
- M1 senders may have at most 4 chunks or 2 MiB of unacknowledged transfer data in flight per active transfer stream, whichever limit is reached first.
- A receiver should acknowledge at least every 4 chunks and must send a final `TransferChunkAck` before completion.
- A sender should pause chunk emission when the receiver stops acknowledging progress.
- A receiver that cannot persist data fast enough should return `ERROR_CODE_TIMEOUT` or a typed transfer error instead of buffering unbounded data.

`TransferChunk.data` is capped at 1 MiB even though the whole `RpcEnvelope` can be up to 4 MiB; the larger envelope limit exists for protobuf overhead and future non-chunk payloads.

## Directory Listing Runtime

- M1 smoke starts with `ListDirRequest.path = "dm://roots/"`, a virtual
  read-only directory that returns available provider roots.
- `ListDirRequest.page_size = 0` means provider default.
- Providers should default to 200 entries and cap at 1,000 entries.
- `page_token` is opaque, tied to query parameters, and invalidated by permission changes or mutations.
- Large directories should return partial pages instead of trying to sort or materialize every entry at once when the provider API allows it.
- Recursive tree walking is out of scope for `ListDir`; future search/index APIs should own recursion.

## Resume Validation

Resume is allowed only when the source fingerprint still matches the original source.

- Size mismatch rejects resume.
- Modified-time mismatch rejects resume unless an opaque provider etag still matches.
- Optional SHA-256 mismatch rejects resume.
- If no fingerprint is available, providers may resume only when the destination offset is zero or when the source provider can otherwise prove stability.

Resume rejection should use `ERROR_CODE_INVALID_ARGUMENT` for stale offsets or `ERROR_CODE_NOT_FOUND` when the source disappeared.

## Error Scenarios for M1 Harness

M1 should explicitly exercise:

- USB unplug during download.
- USB unplug during upload.
- Android permission revoked during listing.
- Android permission revoked during transfer.
- Source file deleted before resume.
- Source file modified before resume.
- Destination becomes read-only.
- Destination runs out of space.
- Invalid page token.
- Oversized envelope.
- Bad payload CRC.
